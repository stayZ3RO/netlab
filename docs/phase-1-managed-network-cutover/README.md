## Documentation Index and Evidence Summary

---

## Overview

Phase 1 documents the historical ER605 and Omada migration from a consumer mesh/router-controlled network to a managed foundation, including AP-mode wireless, redundant DNS, monitoring, and post-cutover validation. The UDM Pro and USW-24-PoE replaced that network core on 2026-09-27.

The purpose of this phase was to complete the managed router/switch cutover first, confirm all core services survived the change, and create a stable baseline before introducing VLAN segmentation.

## Next Phase

Phase 2 will introduce VLAN segmentation, subnet planning, firewall policy, and SSID-to-VLAN mapping.
