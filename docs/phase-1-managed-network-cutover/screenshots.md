## Screenshot Evidence for the Managed Network Cutover

---

## Overview

This page contains screenshot evidence captured after the managed network cutover.

These historical Phase 1 screenshots validate that routing, switching, DHCP, DNS, monitoring, management access, and remote access remained operational after moving to the ER605 router, managed switch, and AP-mode wireless design. The current UDM Pro and USW-24-PoE core replaced that hardware on 2026-09-27.
