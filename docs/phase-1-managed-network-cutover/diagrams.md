## Overview

These text diagrams record the historical Phase 1 ER605 and Omada cutover before the 2026-09-27 UniFi refresh. The [current UniFi topology](../../diagrams/current-topology.md) shows the later network core.

The diagrams should make the network easy to understand without requiring access to the actual environment.
