## Managed Router/Switch Cutover, Omada SDN, AP Mode, and VLAN-Ready Network Foundation

---

This repository documents Project 2 of my home network infrastructure lab: the migration from a consumer mesh/router-controlled network to a managed network foundation using a dedicated router/firewall, managed switch, Omada SDN Controller, AP-mode wireless, redundant DNS, Proxmox-hosted services, and monitoring validation.

Project 1 focused on building reliable core infrastructure services such as HA DNS, Unbound recursive DNS, monitoring, alerting, Tailscale remote access, Proxmox-hosted services, and operational validation.

Project 2 builds on that foundation by moving the network to managed routing and switching, creating the baseline required for VLAN segmentation, firewall policy, SSID-to-VLAN mapping, and enterprise-style network administration.

## About This Project

This project documents the cutover from a consumer home network design into a more controlled, managed infrastructure model.

The main goal was to move routing and switching responsibilities away from the mesh system and into dedicated network infrastructure while keeping core services stable.

This phase introduced:

- Dedicated routing with TP-Link ER605
- Managed switching with TP-Link TL-SG2210P
- Deco mesh operating in AP mode
- Omada SDN-based device visibility
- Redundant Pi-hole DNS with virtual IP failover
- Proxmox-hosted infrastructure services
- Monitoring validation after the cutover
- A stable baseline for VLAN segmentation

---

## Why I Built This

I built this project to practice the kind of work that sits between service desk, network administration, systems administration, and infrastructure engineering.

Instead of only documenting a working home network, this project focuses on the operational side of infrastructure changes:

- Planning a live network cutover
- Validating DNS, DHCP, internet, and service reachability
- Reducing double NAT and consumer-router limitations
- Preserving monitoring and remote access during topology changes
- Creating a VLAN-ready foundation before introducing segmentation
- Documenting the environment in a clear, professional, portfolio-ready format

## Completed and Planned Phases

| Phase | Status | Focus |
|---|---:|---|
| Phase 1 - Managed Router/Switch Cutover | ✅ Complete | ER605 cutover, managed switch integration, Deco AP mode, baseline validation |
| Phase 2 - VLAN Segmentation | ⏳ Planned | VLAN IDs, subnet plan, network zones, DHCP scopes |
| Phase 3 - Firewall Policy | ⏳ Planned | Inter-VLAN rules, restricted management access, IoT/guest isolation |
| Phase 4 - Wireless SSID Mapping | ⏳ Planned | SSID-to-VLAN mapping for trusted, guest, IoT, and lab wireless |
| Phase 5 - Monitoring and Operations | ⏳ Planned | Monitoring updates, dashboards, runbooks, backups, validation procedures |

Hardware refresh (2026-09-27): the ER605 and TL-SG2210P were replaced by a UniFi Dream Machine Pro and a USW-24-PoE in an equivalent-state cutover. The network stayed the same (flat `192.168.68.0/24`, same gateway, DHCP, and DNS), and the Deco units stay in AP mode. Phase 1 documents the ER605 and Omada cutover as it happened; Phase 2 onward runs on the UniFi hardware.
